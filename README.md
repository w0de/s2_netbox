This gem provides Ruby bindings to the [S2 NetBox](http://s2sys.com/products/access-control-systems/netbox/) API for [S2 Security Systems](http://s2sys.com/) products.

# Currently Supported API methods

Through `S2Netbox::ApiRequest` class to invoke any API command on the S2 controller by hand, however only the specific ones we're using have been built out and tested.

The specific methods implemented Usage section.  See the section "Other Commands" for details on how to invoke any arbitrary command in addition to the list of "supported" commands below.

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 's2_netbox'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install s2_netbox

# Configuration

A call to `S2Netbox.configure` must be made before API requests can be made.  This sets up the controller's base URL as well as the username and password used when logging in.

```ruby
S2Netbox.configure do |config|
    config.controller_url = 'https://controller-host'
    config.username = 'api'
    config.password  = '[W2tnwoUdE+/97o8nmi#P77t'
end
```

If you're using the S2Netbox gem in a Rails app, this could be placed in an initializer.

# Usage

All requests are bundled up into the required XML parcel with the required `COMMAND` and `PARAMS`.

Once sent to the configured S2 controller, the response is wrapped up in an instance of `S2Netbox::Response` which includes the following accessors:

* `code`
* `success`
* `details`
* `error_message`
* `raw_request`
* `raw_response`
* `session_id`

`code` returns the raw code response which is typically either `SUCCESS` or `FAIL`, but sometimes has weird other alternatives, such as `DUPLICATE` or `NOT FOUND` just to keep things interesting.

`success` is a boolean indicating if the `code` was `SUCCESS`.  Any other value for `code` results in `success` being `false`.

`details` is a hash of the returned details. For example, when getting a Person object, this will contain the person's attributes, such as `FIRSTNAME` and `LASTNAME` as well as a hash of `ACCESSLEVELS`.  The details hash is keyed off the raw names of the XML attributes in the response (uppercase names, as a string, not symbol) so access them like:

```ruby
result.details['FIRSTNAME']
```

not

```ruby
result.details[:first_name]
```
`error_message` is populated with the error message returned from the system assuming `code` is not `SUCCESS`.

The `raw_request` and `raw_response` store the contents of the HTTP Post request and response respectively, so you can troubleshoot exactly what XML was sent and received by the systems.

`session_id` contains the value of the `session_id` attribute if it exists on the root `<NETBOX>` element in the `raw_response`.  This is only populated in response to the `Login` command.  Use this when parsing the result of a `Login` attempt and store the `session_id` for future requests.

# Authentication

The gem supports authentication by username and password only. Although you can configure it to use the `sha_password` method of authentication, at present the MAC signature is not generated or included with any request.

If your S2 system requires authentication via the `sha_password` and MAC signing, feel free to open a pull request :) Our systems are partitioned and don't use this form of authentication, but we'd love to accept a pull request to add this fucntionaltiy for other users.

## Login

Login is used to establish a session and obtain a `session_id` which is used in subsequent requests:

```ruby
      @result = S2Netbox::Commands::Authentication.login
```

To get an instance of `S2Netbox::Response` which (assuming log in is successful) will include the `session_id` which can be used in subsequent requests:

```ruby
    @result.session_id
```

## Logout

All sessions must be logged out. According to the S2 documentation:

> WARNING: Failure to match every call to ‘Login’ with a call to ‘Logout’ will result in the accumulation of session files, consuming potentially large amounts of disk space.

To log out, issue the `logout` command:

```ruby
result = S2Netbox::Commands::Authentication.logout('session_id_from_login')
```

# Version

The `Version` module allows you to query the current API version.  This is really just an easy way to validate you're successfully connected to the S2 Controller and have a valid session.
## GetVersion

```ruby
result = S2Netbox::Commands::ApiVersion.get_version('session_id_from_login')
```

The result object will contain the version (assuming you've successfully logged in):

```ruby
:001 > puts @result.details['APIVERSION']
4.1
```

# Person

The `Person` module allows you to add and modify Person records.

Methods accept:

1. Person ID
1. Hash of person attributes
1. List of access levels
1. List of User Defined Fields
1. (Optional) session_id

## AddPerson

```ruby
result = S2Netbox::Commands::Person.add({
    :person_id => '8a806ed6-0246-49d0-b7a7-ab6402da01e3',
    :first_name => 'John',
    :last_name => 'Appleseed',
    :exp_date => nil,
    :act_date => '10/10/2016'
    }, %w(AccessLevel1 AccessLevel2), 'UDF1'
)
```

Both accesslevels and user_defined_fields can be specified either as a single string or as an array of strings.

## ModifyPerson

```ruby
result = S2Netbox::Commands::Person.modify('8a806ed6-0246-49d0-b7a7-ab6402da01e3', {
    :first_name => 'John',
    :last_name => 'Appleseed',
    :exp_date => nil,
    :act_date => '10/10/2016'
}, %w(AccessLevel1 AccessLevel2), 'UDF1')
```

If supplied, this method rewrite accesslevels and user_defined_fields

## SearchPersonData

This method accepts an arbitrary hash of valid s2 fields as search pararms.

The api has no documented pagination limit - 167 records is often but not always the limit.

```ruby
result = S2Netbox::Commands::Person.find({
    :first_name => 'John',
    :last_name => 'Appleseed',
})
```

For result sets larger than one page, use the `pagination` helper method.

```ruby
result = S2Netbox::Commands::Person.find({
    :first_name => 'John',
    :last_name => 'Appleseed',
})
result
```

```ruby
result = S2Netbox::Commands::Person.find({
    :first_name => 'John',
    :last_name => 'Appleseed',
})
```



# Credential

## Add

The `add` method accepts 2 arguments:

1. Hash of credential attributes
1. (Optional) session_id

```ruby
result = S2Netbox::Commands::Credential.add({
    :person_id => '8a806ed6-0246-49d0-b7a7-ab6402da01e3',
    :encoded_num => '3113',
    :card_format => '26 bit Wiegand'
})
```

This will add a 26 bit Wiegand encoded card with card number 3113 to the Person record identified by ID `8a806ed6-0246-49d0-b7a7-ab6402da01e3` in the S2 controller.


## Modify

The `modify` method accepts 2 arguments:

1. Hash of credential attributes
1. (Optional) session_id

```ruby
result = S2Netbox::Commands::Credential.add({
    :encoded_num => '3113',
    :disabled => 1
})
```

This example will set `disabled` to `1` (a truthy value) for the credential identified with the `ENCODEDNUM` of `3113` in the S2 Controller.

# Other Commands

By using the `S2Netbox::ApiRequest` class directly, you can send any command to the S2 Controller.

The `send_request` method allows commands to be sent to the S2 Controller and accepts the following arguments:

1. The command name
1. A hash of the command attributes
1. (Optional) session_id

For instance, although untested, you should be able to set a lockdown level by sending the command:

```ruby
S2Netbox::ApiRequest.send_request('SetThreatLevel', {:level_group_name => 'Elevated'})
```

Will set the current threat level to the threat level with a name of `Elevated` in the S2 Controller.

## Sending commands to other endpoints

The `S2Netbox::ApiRequest.send_request` method sends requests to the `/goforms/nbapi` endpoint.

For finer grained control and advanced requests, including the ability to change this path, you can call the lower level `S2Netbox.request` method.

The `S2Netbox::request` method takes three arguments:

1. Url
1. Command
1. (Optional) session_id

The `url` argument is the path to the API endpoint, such as `/goforms/nbapi`.

The `command` argument is the raw XML command that will be placed within the `<NETBOX-API>` element.

Pass in the optional `session_id` if you’re using username and password based authentication.

# Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
